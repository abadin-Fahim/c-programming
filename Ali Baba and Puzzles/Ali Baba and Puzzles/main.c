/*
 Problem Statement: One day, Ali Baba had an easy puzzle that he couldn't solve. The puzzle consisted of 4 numbers and his task was to check whether he could get the fourth number using arithmetic operators (+,−,×) between the other three numbers; so that each operator is used only once.
𝑎  ◻   𝑏  ◻   𝑐  =   𝑑
