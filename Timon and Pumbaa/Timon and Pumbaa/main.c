/*
 Problem Statement: Timon has 𝑎 candies and his friend, Pumbaa, has 𝑏 candies, so Pumbaa asked Timon to tell him the value of 𝑎−𝑏. However, Timon will tell him the value of 𝑎−𝑏 if the value is ≥0; otherwise, he will lie and say 0. Since it was a hard task for Timon, he's asking for your help.
Given two numbers 𝑎 and 𝑏, find the answer.
